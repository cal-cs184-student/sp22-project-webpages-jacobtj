        <p>
            In this project, I was able to generate rays and calculate their intersections with triangles, spheres, and planes. Using rays and their intersections, I was able to render objects with normal shading. I then
            worked on constructing a bounding volume hierarchy to increase the efficiency of finding intersections between a ray and the objects in the images. Instead of looping through the entire bounding box of an object 
            to render it, I recursively traversed through the bounding volume hierarchy, skipping portions where the ray didn't intersect with the bounding box and calculating intersections for all the primitives only when
            I reached a leaf node of this tree structure. Thus, rendering images became much more efficient through this implementation. While working through Part 2 of this project, I spent multiple days trying to construct
            a heuristic for the splitting of the bounding box that did not get stuck splitting 5 primitives into a section with 0 primitives in it (which caused an infinite loop). After attempting 10+ heuristics, I am still
            unclear on what finally fixed my solution. It appears that one of the heursitics just began working after implementing tasks 2 and 3 of Part 2. The next portion of the project involved simulating light and rendering images with
            realistic shading; however, I was only able to implement shading for zero-bounce illumination, as I did not have enough time to complete the direct lighting portion of this part or the rest of the project due to
            the long rendering and debugging times and the excessive amount of time spent debugging Part 2.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
        <p>
            I generated rays by taking the coordinates of an image, converting those coordinates from image space to a ray in camera space using scaling and traslations, and then trasforming the ray from camera space
            into world space. Then, I updated pixels in the sample buffer by generating rays and estimating the scene radiance along those rays to estimate the value of each pixel. To start rendering images, I
            implemented ray triangle and ray sphere intersection functions. These ray intersesction functions are the start of rendering images as we could compute the intersection of a ray with every triangle in a mesh
            to render that image. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To define the ray triangle intersection function, I used the MÃ¶ller Trumbore Algorithm which solves for the t in the ray equation r(t) = o + td that intersections the triangle and the barycentric
            coordinates b0, b1, b2 that we can interpolate with the vertex normals of the triangle to calculate the surface normal at the intersection. I confirmed that the intersection was valid by making sure the value of 
            t was greater than or equal to 0 and was between min_t and max_t of the Ray. I used these calculated values to update the properties of the Intersection object and the max_t of the ray. Below are some images with normal shading rendered using the above implementation.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
            To construct a bounding volume hierarchy, I first initialized a bounding box. I then looped through all the primitives and used the expand()
            function of the bounding box to create a bounding box that encompassed all of the primitives. Using this bounding box, I initalized a node. If the 
            number of primitives was less than or equal to the max_leaf_size parameter, the node created would be a leaf node, so I set the start and end pointers
            of the leaf node and returned it. If the number of primitives was greater than the max_leaf_size, then I needed to split the bounding box. To split the
            bounding box, I used a heuristic that took the mean centroid of all the primitives and the max and min vectors of the bounding box. I used these 3 points
            to create a plane to divide the bounding box. I used the partition function to divide the primitives into those that fell on one side of the plane and
            those that fell on the opposite side of the plane. Because the plane included the mean centroid as one of the points, there would always be at least 1 
            primitive that fell on either side of the plane, allowing for the splitting to continue. Below are some images generated using the bounding volume
            hierarchy acceleration.

        <p>
            Below are some images with significant speed improvements due to the bounding volume hierarchy acceleration. Before the speedup, they took around 40-60
            seconds to render.  Meanwhile, after the implementation of part 2, they render in less than a second (0.1579s for the cow and 0.1338s for the beetle). This speedup is due to the fact that we don't have 
            to loop through the entire bounding box to check for intersections. We are able to skip a lot of that work by skipping over sections where there is 
            no intersection between the ray and the bounding box, leading to the significant speedups seen.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
        <p>
            For this part of the project, I was to complete and render images for Task 1: Diffuse BSDF and 2: Zero-bounce Illumination. For the first part, I returned the reflectance of the incoming and outgoing
            solid angle vectors. For the second part, I returned the emission of objects that intersected the bounding box of the bvh. However, I was unable to get the images from the direct lighting portions of 
            this part to render correctly.
